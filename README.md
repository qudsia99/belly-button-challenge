Interactive Dashboard that explores a belly button biodiversity dataset

### General Info:

This dashboard takes data from ```https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json``` of belly button sample data, creating a quick overview panel that displays metadata based on selected sample from drop down. Further corresponding data can be viewed by the bar graph of OTU id's and bacteria data in the color-coded bubble graph, that has interactive labels upon hovering mouse on data.
